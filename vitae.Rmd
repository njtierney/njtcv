# Service

I am an active member of the statistics and open source software communities. I  recently joined the R Journal as an Associate Editor, served on the organising committee of UseR! 2018 in Brisbane, and was the founding and principal organiser of the annual rOpenSci Ozunconference, from 2016 - 2018, and assistant organiser in 2019. I have been the organising chair of two university research groups, the Non‐Uniform Monash Business Analytics Team (NUMBAT) group at Monash, and the Bayesian Research and Applications Group (BRAG) at Queensland University of Technology. I have been a member of the Statistical Society of Australia since 2013, serving as young statistician representative of Queensland, and assistant chair of biostatistics (2013-2016), and a general committee member of the Victoria branch (2017 - 2019).
